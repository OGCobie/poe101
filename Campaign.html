                Path of Exile's campaign spans 10 acts across the dark continent of Wraeclast. You'll face corrupted beasts, fallen gods, and ancient evils as you uncover the truth behind your exile. Each act introduces new mechanics, challenges, and enemies that will test your build and skill. The journey typically takes 6-10 hours for experienced players, longer for newcomers.
